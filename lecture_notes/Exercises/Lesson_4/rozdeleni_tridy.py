# Class division
# Lets say we a class students stored in a list `trida = ["Kevin", "Honza", "Radek", "Tue", "Adéla", "Vojta"]` and we need to divide the class into two halves. We want to have every odd member in one list and every even member in a second list. The result should look like this: `trida_a = ["Honza", "Tue", "Vojta"]` and `trida_b = ["Kevin", "Radek", "Adéla"]`

trida = ["Kevin", "Honza", "Radek", "Tue", "Adéla", "Vojta"]
trida_a = []
trida_b = []
